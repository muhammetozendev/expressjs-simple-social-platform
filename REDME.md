# Description

This is an extremely simple version of a social application. It implements design patterns like dependency injection, repository design pattern and factory design pattern. This project can be used to structure any other node / express based scalable backend applications.

Side note: DI container is implemented manually but it's always a better practice to use an industry standard package or solution
